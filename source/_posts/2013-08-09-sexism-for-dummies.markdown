Yesterday, I saw a [screenshot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattgemmell/9465578396/) of a hiring ad from a 
[German web development agency](http://www.bloopark.com) that is so blatantly sexist, it would be [illegal in the United States](http://www.eeoc.gov/employees/charge.cfm).

Occasionally when discussing charges of sexism in mixed company, I'll get someone who says they just don't get it. Like the [Stephen Colbert segment on Color-blindness](http://www.hulu.com/watch/514294), they claim they're just so equality-minded that they don't see subtle use of language as sexist. They reject the claim that choice of phrasing and subtle language cues can often betray a speaker or writer's prejudices and attitudes toward gender (I'm thinking specifically of a conversation I once had with [Vanessa Hurst](http://www.twitter.com/DBness) from [GirlDevelopIt](http://www.girldevelopit.com/)).

Thankfully, this job posting makes no attempts to hide its prejudice. I think almost everyone can agree it's discriminatory and reveals quite a bit about the culture (or lack thereof) at the company in question. So I think it would make a great instructional tool to help the gender-blind understand some of the more subtle aspects of gender discrimination.

Let's start with the job listing in question.

1. **Lipstick** Do all women like to wear lipstick? Don't some men like to wear lipstick? This graphic reiforces the idea of [gender roles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_roles). It makes assumptions about the way women behave, and it implies that women in a workplace environment need to be more concerned about their appearance than men do (or else wouldn't the male listing feature a comb and razor?).
