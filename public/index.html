		<p>Yesterday, I saw a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattgemmell/9465578396/">screenshot</a> of a hiring ad from a
<a href="http://www.bloopark.com">German web development agency</a> that is so blatantly sexist, it would be <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/employees/charge.cfm">illegal in the United States</a>.</p>

<p>Occasionally when discussing charges of sexism in mixed company, I&rsquo;ll get someone who says they just don&rsquo;t get it. Like the <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/514294">Stephen Colbert segment on Color-blindness</a>, they claim they&rsquo;re just so equality-minded that they don&rsquo;t see subtle use of language as sexist. They reject the claim that choice of phrasing and subtle language cues can often betray a speaker or writer&rsquo;s prejudices and attitudes toward gender (I&rsquo;m thinking specifically of a conversation I once had with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/DBness">Vanessa Hurst</a> from <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/">GirlDevelopIt</a>).</p>

<p>Thankfully, this job posting makes no attempts to hide its prejudice. I think almost everyone can agree it&rsquo;s discriminatory and reveals quite a bit about the culture (or lack thereof) at the company in question. So I think it would make a great instructional tool to help the gender-blind understand some of the more subtle aspects of gender discrimination.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the job listing in question.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Lipstick</strong> Do all women like to wear lipstick? Don&rsquo;t some men like to wear lipstick? This graphic reiforces the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_roles">gender roles</a>. It makes assumptions about the way women behave, and it implies that women in a workplace environment need to be more concerned about their appearance than men do (or else wouldn&rsquo;t the male listing feature a comb and razor?).</li>
<li></li>

		<p>I stayed in a bed &amp; breakfast at Harvard Square this weekend and found the most amazing hotel computer setup I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I just have to share this.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><em>I went through my old blog, and sadly, the only post I think is worth saving, is my famous sangria recipe. Whatever that says about me, I am willing to accept.</em></p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This sangria is incredibly alcoholic and will knock you on your ass after two or three glasses. Makes about 3.5L of sangria plus a bunch of alcoholic fruit that contain more alcohol than you think. You&rsquo;ll need at least a 5L jug for this. Serves around 20 people 2-3 glasses each.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>1.75L dry red wine (Yellowtail Merlot is fine)</li>
<li>1 cup Gosling&rsquo;s spiced rum</li>
<li>1 cup Mr. Boston Blackberry-flavored brandy</li>
<li>&frac12; cup Peachtree Schnapps</li>
<li>&frac12; cup Cointreau (or Triple Sec if you&rsquo;re cheap or want to reduce the alcohol content)</li>
<li>1 cup orange juice (the only time in life that no pulp is acceptable)</li>
<li>4 Tsp sugar</li>
<li>4 cans ginger ale</li>
<li>2 lemons</li>
<li>2 limes</li>
<li>2 apples</li>
<li>4 oranges</li>
<li>1 cup strawberries</li>
<li>1 cup raspberries</li>
<li>1 can diced pineapples in juice</li>
</ul>


<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Pour all the alcohol, mixers, and fruit juice in a big freaking pitcher</li>
<li>Pour in the sugar and stir it for awhile</li>
<li>Cut all the fruit into half-slices and throw all the fruit slices (and any juice) in the pitcher</li>
<li>Holy crap, don&rsquo;t drink it yet. Let it sit for 48 hours, 24 hours minimum. Seriously. Stop that. Don&rsquo;t drink it.</li>
<li>When it&rsquo;s time to serve, add the cans of ginger ale.</li>
<li>Slice the remaining oranges and slot them. Serve with a lot of ice in red wine glasses with the slotted orange slices as garnish.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Why I love this recipe:</h3>

<p>Goslings and ginger ale make it a bit spicy, which takes most people by surprise. There is a ridiculous amount of alcohol in here, even moreso if you eat the fruit. Like seriously, watch out. If you don&rsquo;t believe me about the 48 hour wait, try sampling the sangria as soon as you pour it and every 12 hours. The nasty acidic taste in the cheap wine decreases over time and will completely disappear within 48 hours.</p>

<p>Some people have claimed that this is not true sangria, but is in fact a cocktail, owing to the unusally large amount of liquor in the recipe. To that, I say have two or three glasses, and let&rsquo;s settle this with a fist fight.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

		<p>If you’re a programmer early in your career, you’ve probably heard a lot of people talk about the importance of having a strong network. It’s true. For things like finding a job, a co-founder, or just someone to get advice from, having a strong professional network is invaluable. But the hard part is actually building one, or even knowing how to begin.</p>

<p>The easiest way seems to be to go to networking events. There’s a big problem with this approach though, and that is that <strong>87% of networking event attendees are doing it completely wrong</strong>. Ok, so I made that number up, but hear me out anyway.</p>

<p>If you go to any kind of tech meetup, you will see all sorts of people trying to “build their networks.” They seem to be doing this by walking around, engaging in varying degrees of shameless self-promotion, and trading business cards with as many people as possible. As far as I can tell, the meetup-goer who employs this strategy is expecting that one day, they will have a specific need to use their network for something. They will go directly to their stack of business cards, each one a legally binding contract to call in one favor, and solve their problem with a single email or phone call.</p>

<p>The problem is, of course, that if you have to go to a stack of business cards (or to LinkedIn) to figure out who’s in your network, you’ve already failed. This kind of networking is completely wrong twice. It’s wrong because it’s not going to work, and it’s wrong because it’s a soulless form of quid pro quo that is unbefitting of human beings.</p>

<p>The most helpful people in your network are going to help you not because they expect something in return, but because – get this – they actually like you. So stop trying to make “connections” and “business contacts,” and start trying to make friends. You know, like people do. In life.</p>

<p>Here’s how I suggest approaching meetups and professional networking events. Go with a friend or two. Introduce them to each other and anyone you know at the event. Have them introduce you to some people they know that you don’t. Afterward, grab drinks, or dinner with the friends you’ve brought, and their friends. Have a fun evening.</p>

<p>You can even make a game out of this method. Take the number of business cards you’ve collected (business cards with QR codes count double) and subtract the number of new friends you’ve made. Score it like golf. Par is 2.</p>

<p>I scored a 1 at the last <a href="http://www.outintech.org">Out In Tech</a> event. I score under par fairly consistently at <a href="http://www.ctoschool.org">CTO School</a>, owing mainly to the wine bar after the event. I stopped going to the meetups where I was consistently scoring triple-bogeys, and I’ve been much happier for it. Try this out, and I think you will be too.</p>

		<p>How would you feel, years later, about a college that issued a statement in support of Loving v. Virginia and then retracted it due to pressure from its alumns?</p>

<p>Today my alma mater &ldquo;officially&rdquo; <del>retracted</del> apologized for a Facebook post celebrating the repeal of DOMA, which allowed the many LGBT Olin College community members &ndash; faculty, staff, students, and alumns &ndash; who are married or will be married in the state of Massachusetts &ndash; to enjoy equal protection under federal law.</p>

<blockquote><p>As a matter of policy, Olin College does not endorse any political candidate or political cause, or any religious point of view.</p></blockquote>

<p>Where is the controversy? Marriage equality is now the law in your state and in your country. Does Olin College hold no official position on marriage between heterosexual couples?</p>

<p>Shame on you, whoever made that call. Ordering an employee to <del>remove</del> disown that post <em>was</em> a statement. It was a statement that you would rather disown the LGBT Olin community than risk offending the tender sensibilities of a few bigots. You&rsquo;ve helped create a piece of our collective memory around this historic decision, and it&rsquo;s not one that any of us can be proud of.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 7/12/2013</strong>: It was called to my attention that Olin didn&rsquo;t actually delete the Facebook post, they only issued an apology for it. My mistake.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that the original post had 120 likes and only 2 detractors. The Olin community is still a very open and accepting one.</p>

		<p>My good friend James Somers wrote <a href="http://www.aeonmagazine.com/living-together/james-somers-web-developer-money/">this article</a> for Aeon Magazine. It&rsquo;s a great article, well-written as I&rsquo;ve come to expect from James, and there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack &ndash; the idea that programming is basically plumbing, that venture-backed startups are essentially time-wasting factories of frivolity, and that our economic system&rsquo;s basis in supply and demand massively undervalues creative workers like writers &ndash; but there is one idea I want to focus on in particular, because I think I have some insight into the argument that James doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have a friend who’s a mechanical engineer. He used to build airplane engines for General Electric, and now he’s trying to develop a smarter pill bottle to improve compliance for AIDS and cancer patients. He works out of a start-up ‘incubator’, in an office space shared with dozens of web companies. He doesn’t have a lot of patience for them. ‘I’m fucking sick of it,’ he told me, ‘all they talk about is colours.’</p></blockquote>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s abundantly clear that this is a false contrast &ndash; rhetorically effective perhaps, but misleading. By contrasting the social good of curing terminal illness with the inanity of arguing over colors, James trivializes software engineering and elevates more traditional forms of engineering.</p>

<p>But he just as easily could have contrasted a mechanical engineer who makes Happy Meal toys to a <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/see-your-work-product-in-its-natural-habitat/">software engineer who writes child welfare software</a>. A huge number of plastics manufacturing jobs are dedicated to cheap toys that end their lives in landfills, but that doesn&rsquo;t take away from medicine bottles any more than <a href="http://www.wheremydogsat.com/">Facebook for dogs</a> takes away from <a href="http://www.kiva.org">crowdfunding female entrepreneurs in third world countries</a>.</p>

<p>Colors can be important. They can also be inane. I can tell you from experience that mechanical engineering is not free of mundane details &ndash; draft angles, radii, and of course &ndash; color. Nor is it free of what James earlier in the article calls knowing the &ldquo;instruction manual.&rdquo; In fact, for MEs, this is tenfold. I can still recite for you the names and compositions of commonly used alloys, rules of thumb for designing machined parts &ndash; depths of cut, recommended spindle speeds, and common design features of injection molded parts like bosses and living hinges &ndash; all rote knowledge accidentally commited to permanent memory through a few years of practice. And the ultimate instruction manual for traditional engineers? The $100k four-year instruction manual called a B.S. Engineering.</p>

<blockquote><p>My friends and I who are building websites — we’re kids! We’re kids playing around with tools given to us by adults. In decreasing order of adultness, and leaving out an awful lot, I’m talking about things such as: the Von Neumann stored program computing architecture; the transistor; high-throughput fibre-optic cables; the Unix operating system; the sci-fi-ish cloud computing platform; the web browser; the iPhone; the open source movement; Ruby on Rails; the Stack Overflow Q&amp;A site for programmers; on and on, all the way down to the code that my slightly-more-adult co-workers write for my benefit.</p></blockquote>

<p>When James speaks of abstractions as though they&rsquo;re a bad thing &ndash; something for dull people to be able to wrap their heads around instead of bothering themselves with the intellectual challenges of Djikstra and Turing, he ignores the existance of abstractions in every other creative discipline. Mechanical engineers learn physics in the same way that computer scientists learn linear algebra. One day they may use it a few times, but mostly, they&rsquo;re using reference tables to calculate moments of inertia in that same way that Ruby developers might use Math.rand() instead of writing their own pesudeorandom number generator.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/blog/303-table.jpg" alt="303 Stainless Steel Machinability Table" /></p>

<p>But that isn&rsquo;t to say this article is all bad. Quite the contrary. I really appreciate raising the issue of how society values its workforce. We all know that it&rsquo;s a great injustice how little teachers are paid, and how much better off society would be if we could attract more and higher quality educators to the profession. But singling out software engineers who make $100k a year, while ignoring bankers who make five times as much, and giving a free pass to makers of other disciplines with similar problems, seems disingenuous. Especially when software engineering is such a force for economic betterment, with its highly results-oriented, meritocratic culture. I know a programmer who was homeless on the streets in New York for years. He taught himself how to program, and now he&rsquo;s self-sufficient. Software engineers are free of the expensive artificial certifications that create massive barriers to entry for people entering law, finance, and yes &ndash; mechanical engineering. This is why I&rsquo;m excited about companies like <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> and <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>.</p>

<p>Given all of that, it seems James is attacking the wrong target. The question may not be why are software engineers valued so highly, but why are the artists and writers he mentions valued so poorly? The answer to that, I think is much more elusive, one that maybe someday James will tackle with his incomparable wit and candor, but perhaps this time without the straw man.</p>
